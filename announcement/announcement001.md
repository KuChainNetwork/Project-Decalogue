**Dear participants:**



KuChain is KuGroup’s public chain project designed to answer the needs of the current decentralized financial sector, which in the future will serve as the Mainnet of KuCoin’s platform token KCS. 

The Testnet of KuChain - Kratos, is co-ordinal with KuChain in concept, architecture and resource, as it serves the role of KuChain’s initial version prior to mainnet launch.

Providing an experimental environment, Kratos encourages decentralized financial product pioneers to test and prove their innovative technologies and notions: for instance, DEX, DeFi, stable-coin, among others. As well as try out and contribute to KuChain’s various functionalities spanning governance, staking and validating.



**Prior to that, we here announce the launch of KuChain Betanet on July 1st, 2020, as the Beta version of the upcoming Testnet.**



Together with developer communities such as Cosmos and GoLang, cyber security expert institutions including SlowMist, Chaitin and PeckShield, as well as various partners that have made commitments on contributing to KuChain’s future ecosystem prosperity, the KuChain team is mulling the following two programs special for KuChain Betanet to receive both conceptual and technical “baptism” from the public as a newborn.
