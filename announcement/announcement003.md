Dear participate:



KuChain Betanet Events officially entered to its **second phase** on July 14th, 2020.

We are happy to inform you that **KuChain beta version network** **is now officially launched**! This indicates that in this phase, KuChain Betanet Events not only support developers to locally test the Betanet source code, but also allow developers to conduct direct technical attack against KuChain beta version network.

Aiming to collect suggestions and insights from external professionals on improving the chain conceptually and technically to the maximum extent, **KuChain team decides to extend the events' duration**.

It’s still cyber-smarties’ challenge! It’s still everyone’s spree! It’s still up to **million dollars of “treasure” for tech “hunters”**! 

See you guys here: https://github.com/KuChainNetwork
