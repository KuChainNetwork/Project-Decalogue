#### Review Process

Below is the detail review process of your proposal report.

1. Submit the proposal report on [GitHub](https://github.com/KuChainNetwork/Project-Decalogue/issues).
2. Preliminary examination. Proposal reports that are deemed invalid will be closed, we will inform the proposer with the reason in the comment area under the proposal report (e.g. out of scope, incorrect report format, duplicates). Valid proposals will be qualified for the next round of review.
3. The effective proposals which have passed the preliminary examination will remain open to public discussion and vote on GitHub till the end of the event. In case more specifications are needed when voting, we strongly encourage and recommend interactions with proposers in the comment area under each proposal.
4. A week after the end of Proposal Award Program, an official announcement will be publicized on GitHub, citing top 10 rewarded proposals, including the proposers, ranking and the corresponding rewards. The result will also be delivered to the winning proposers by email.
5. Rewards will be paid out in KCS to an ERC-20 address of the winners' two weeks after the official announcement of the result.
